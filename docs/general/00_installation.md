# Installation

These userscripts should be used with browsers addons such as Violentmonkey, Firemonkey, Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.
To ease the installation process, you can use an HTTP server serving the repository directory and install them directly from the webpage.
For example, the command `python3 -m http.server` will create a simple HTTP server that serves files from the current directory.
